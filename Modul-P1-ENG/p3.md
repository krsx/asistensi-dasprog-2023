# Asteroid Odyssey: Ringing Mysteries of the Space Realm

## Problem Description

In a space mission, the spacecraft **SpaceY** was sent to explore a very mysterious small planet. This planet is known as **Xonar** and has become the center of attention for scientists and space explorers throughout the universe. What makes **Xonar** so unique is the large ring that surrounds it, consisting of `65,356` asteroids of various sizes.

The **SpaceY** spacecraft has been set to explore these asteroids, each with a unique name and in sequential order, from `Xo[-32768]` to `Xo[32767]`. Captain Ekbal, a brave leader of this mission, has a challenging task. He must find a specific asteroid believed to contain a rare resource desperately needed by humans on Earth.

One day, while the **SpaceY** spacecraft is on asteroid `m`, Captain Ekbal receives an order to move in the direction `r`. The spacecraft moves past `n` asteroids. Unfortunately, when it reaches its destination, the spacecraft's location determination system malfunctions. Help Captain Ekbal determine the current location of the spacecraft!

`r=1` if moving clockwise, `r=-1` if moving counterclockwise.

**Note**:

- Asteroid `Xo[32767]` is right next to asteroid `Xo[-32768]`.

You are not allowed to use methods beyond what is covered in the P1 module, such as if-else statements, switch-case, and so on.
